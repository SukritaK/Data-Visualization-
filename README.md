Data Visualization with STATA using ESCAP-World Bank Trade Cost Database 

I use the ESCAP-World Bank Trade Cost Database to draw comparisons between Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South & South West Asia (SSWA), which are neighboring regions.*

South Asia has remained the least integrated region over the years. This is corroborated by the data, which shows that in the context of the SSWA sub-region, total trade between Turkyie and Sri Lanka in 2020 cost 169% more in additional costs than the value of the goods, compared to the cost of each of these countries trading within themselves. Between India and Pakistan, this cost of doing trade was 437%. In comparison, it cost Turkyie 91.8% less to trade with the United Kingdom than it did to trade with Sri Lanka, and India 307% less to trade with Australia, despite the increased travel distance.  

For SSWA, trade faciliation and logistics costs (apart from tariff costs) shown by the nontariff costs of trade bars in the graph closely follow the total cost of trade, indicating that they play a key role in hiking up trade costs, as well as indicating that intra-regional trade agreements such as SAFTA have been unable to develop the region into a tariff-free zone, shown by the lag between total cost of trade and nontariff costs of trade. 

Looking at the neighboring bloc ASEAN for comparison, it cost Indonesia and Thailand 88.5% more than the value of the traded goods to do trade with each other, whereas it cost Indonesia 47% more than that to do trade with Germany. The total cost of trade almost equaling nontariff costs of trade within the region could also be indicative of the success in implementing tariff reduction agreements in the region, such as the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (1992).  

The SSWA region faces quite a few bottlenecks in intra-regional trade. For instance, in South Asia, food insecurities have further led countries to adopt restrictive trade policies on food exports. High logistical costs, para-tariffs and inadequate infrastructure are some of the key reasons behind low intra-regional trade in South Asia (Sinha & Sareen, 2020).

*Countries in ASEAN: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam
Countries in SSWA: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Türkiye
